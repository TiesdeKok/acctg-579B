## Setup instructions

This Python course requires a computer that is set up with the appropriate software and tools. This document provides the steps in order to prepare your own computer. 

## What tools will we be using?

The core tools are:

* Python 3.7 
* Anaconda Distribution
* Jupyter Notebooks + Jupyter Lab

We will also use a large collection of third-party Python packages and library. A full list can be found in the [`environment.yml`](https://github.com/TiesdeKok/acctg-579b/blob/master/environment.yml) file. 

## Some important remarks:

> But I already have Python installed on my computer, I surely don't need to do all this?

I'd like everyone to complete the steps, even if you already have Python set up on your computer. Doing so will make sure that everyone has the same setup, this makes solving technical issues a lot more managable. You can have multiple Python installations / Conda environments on your computer, so you don't need to uninstall your current setup. 

One exception is if you already have the Python 3.7 version of Anaconda installed on your computer, in that case you can skip step 1. 

> Do I have to use Jupyter Notebooks? I'd much rather use tool .... 

There are many ways to write Python code and ultimately I recommend you to use whatever you want. However, I would appreciate it if you could use Jupyter Lab + Jupyter Notebooks during this Python course. This makes it easier for everyone to work together and also makes it easier to solve technical problems as they arise. The material is not specific to Jupyter so after the course you switch back to whatever tool you prefer without any problem. 

> I keep getting errors?! What do I do... 

Some of you might encounter problems when following the steps below, but don't worry, I am here to help! I've created a text channel called `setup-help` in the Discord channel. Please post a message in that channel if you need help and I will respond ASAP to help you get it resolved. 

> Everything that you show is on Windows, but I am on Mac OS / Linux? 

All of my demonstrations will be on Windows, however, I'll try to include pointers in cases where I know there are differences between Windows and Unix (i.e. Mac OS and Linux). You should be able to following along with any operating system without too much trouble. 

> How long should it take me to complete these steps?

On a decent computer it shouldn't take more than 30 to 45 minutes to get everything set up. Install Anaconda and the Conda environment will take some time, but besides that should be relatively quick. However, this is obviously conditional on you not running into any problems. 

**I strongly recommend to try and complete these steps as soon as possible, this gives us time to resolve any problems before the course starts.**  

## Setup steps:

###  **Step 0:** make sure you are comfortable with the command line / terminal.

###  **Step 1a:** install the Anaconda Distribution with Python 3.7.

###  **Step 1b:** learn how to interact with the Anaconda Distribution.

###  **Step 2:** (temporarily) download the acctg-579b Github repository

The `ACCTG-579B` GitHub repository is not yet completely done, but it already includes the `environment.yml` file that you need for step 3. So for now just follow the video and create a local copy of this repository: [repository](https://github.com/TiesdeKok/acctg-579B)

###  **Step 3:** create the `researchPython` conda environment

**Note:** in the video the name of the environment is slightly different, but the steps are exactly the same!

### **Step 4:** test environment by starting and closing a Jupyter Lab session

If Jupyter Lab opens up without issues you are good to go for now! More instructions will follow on how to use Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebooks.

### **Step 5:** run the test notebook to make sure everything is 100% set up correctly.
